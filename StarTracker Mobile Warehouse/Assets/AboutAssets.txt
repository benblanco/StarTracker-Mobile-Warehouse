Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories) and given a Build Action of "AndroidAsset".

These files will be deployed with your package and will be accessible using Android's
AssetManager, like this:

public class ReadAsset : Activity
{
    protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle)
    {
        base.OnCreate (bundle);

        InputStream input = Assets.Open ("my_asset.txt");
    }
}

Additionally, some Android functions will automatically load asset files:

Typeface tf = Typeface.CreateFromAsset (Context.Assets, "fonts/samplefont.ttf");


1. archive to Documents folder (C:\Users\benbl\Documents).
2. Copy to: C:\Users\benbl\AppData\Local\Xamarin\Mono for Android\Archives\ to deploy
3. Save to another folder. (C:\Users\benbl\Source\Workspaces\ST Mobile)
4. then copy the resulting apks to the tablet
